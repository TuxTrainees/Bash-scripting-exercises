# Fourth Excersise

Write a shell script to generate a comprehensive report on user data:
   - List all users on the system.
   - For each user, list the total number of files they own in /home and their total disk usage.
   - Identify users who haven't logged in for more than one week and list their account status.

> [!NOTE]
> Use `cut`, `find`, `lastlog` and any other commands you think are necessary.
